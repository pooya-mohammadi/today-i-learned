# EmoLabel: Semi-Automatic Methodology forEmotion Annotation of Social Media Text

## EmoLabel consists of two main phases:
1) an automatic process of pre-annotation of the unlabelled sentences with a reduced number of emotional categories
   1) This automatic phase assigns limited number of categories!
2) a man-ual refinement process where human annotators determine which  is  the  dominant  emotion  in  the  pre-defined  set  of possibilities.
   1) In this phase human annotators are at peace because they should choose from a limited number of categories!

## Methods for pre-annotation:
1) unsupervised with the aim of minimizing the human intervention
2) supervised where simple emotion models are build up based on current corpora, or other standalone models trained on other corpora.

## Conclusion: supervised vs unsupervised!
1) supervised models performed better compared to unsupervised methods!
